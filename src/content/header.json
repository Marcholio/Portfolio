  "intro": "I'm Markus Tyrkk√∂, a recent graduate from Aalto University, Finland. I studied Information Networks as my major, which gave me an in-depth understanding of combining technology, business and user-centered design. I'm passionate about challenging myself, learning new things and of course, technology. Here are some of the projects I've been working with recently that I can consider \"complete\" at least on some level. You can see many other projects as well on my Github page. If any of them caught your attention, don't hesitate to send me a message.",
